## Contribution Period Details
The launch of the Status Network, and the corresponding token creation process, are organized around smart contracts running on Ethereum.
1. The Contribution Period will begin June 20th, 2017. Instructions on how Contributors can participate will be made available closer to the date of the event.
2. Participants willing to contribute to and support the development of the Status Network can do so by sending ether to the designated address. By doing so contributors create Status Network Tokens (SNT) at the rate of 10,000 SNT per ETH.
3. The SNT creation rate per ETH is fixed, and will remain constant for the duration of the Contribution Period.
4. The number of SNT created depends on the amount of contributions received by the smart contract.
5. The Contribution Period will run for a period of 14 days, or within 24 hours of reaching the first ceiling, of 12M CHF (Swiss Francs) equivalent in ETH, having been reached.
6. Status Research & Development Gmbh controls the contract and the address to which gathered ether will be sent (implemented as a multisig address).
7. SNT received by Contributors will be transferrable 7 days after the end of the Contribution Period.
